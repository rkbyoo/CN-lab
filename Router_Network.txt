GNS3 Lab: Routing Between Two Networks Using a Router

Objective:
Enable communication between two PCs on different networks (10.0.0.0/8 and 11.0.0.0/8) using a router.

Steps:

Delete the switch from the GNS3 topology.

Add a router and connect:

FastEthernet0/0 to PC1

FastEthernet0/1 to PC2

Start the router and open its console.
Wait for the prompt to appear.

Enter privileged mode:
enable

Enter global configuration mode:
configure terminal

Configure FastEthernet0/0 (connected to PC1):
interface FastEthernet0/0
ip address 10.0.0.254 255.0.0.0
no shutdown

Configure FastEthernet0/1 (connected to PC2):
interface FastEthernet0/1
ip address 11.0.0.254 255.0.0.0
no shutdown
exit

Exit configuration mode:
exit

On PC1, open console and run:
ip 10.0.0.1/8 10.0.0.254
save

On PC2, open console and run:
ip 11.0.0.1/8 11.0.0.254
save

Test connectivity:
From PC1: ping 11.0.0.1
From PC2: ping 10.0.0.1
